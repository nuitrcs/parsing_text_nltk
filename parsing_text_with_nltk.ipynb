        "\n",
        "NLP is broadly about using computers to manipulate the type of text that humans use for everyday communication. This can be very simple or very complicated. This notebook focuses on the simpler end of the spectrum, on which some other methods build.\n",
        "\n",
        "NLTK was created in 2001 at the University of Pennsylvania and is widely embraced in academia. There are other libraries, such as [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), which are also helpful and commonly used. One advantage of NLTK is that it provides lots of customization.\n",

        "This notebook focuses mainly on how to parse text to create bags of words. In other words, this notebook teaches how to go from raw text (a string) to a list of tokens (e(.g., words) that can be used for different purposes. At a high-level, this is the process that we'll be covering: raw text -> tokenizing -> creating frequency distributions. As you'll discover, each of these steps has its own complexity...

        "- We're treating differently words that convey similar information (e.g., \"meditation\" and \"meditate\" or \"mindfulness\" and \"mindful\"). Fortunately, we can address this problem with stemming and lemmatization. Stemming consists in keeping only the stem of a word, removing \"the end\" of the word (e.g., \"manufactur\" instead of \"manufacturing\"). Lemmatizing is similar to stemming, but making sure that the resulting word exists in the dictionary. Since lemmatizing involves further computation, it is slower than stemming. Fortunately, NLTK includes off-the-shelf stemmers and lemmatizers! However, as it is more generally the case with tokenizing, you should select the stemmer/lemmatizer that best fits your needs.\n",
        "- We're focusing on single words (or *unigrams*). However, sometimes the meaning of words changes when they're together with another/other word(s) (e.g., \"White House\" vs \"White\" and \"House\" or \"Thich Nhat Hanh\" vs \"Thich\", \"Nhat\", and \"Hanh\"). To address this problem, we can tokenize posts into *n-grams*, particularly *bi-grams* and *tri-grams*, or ordered sets of n, 2, and 3 words, respectively. This increases the number of unique tokens, but retains more information.\n",
